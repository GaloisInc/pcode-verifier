This source archive contains all pieces necessary to get started with
the Crucible symbolic simulator for PCode.

The overall system consists of sevaral pieces:
  * the main symbolic simulator (named Crucible) that is written in Haskell;
  * a Java API which binds to a separate Crucible process using Google's
    protocol buffers;
  * a Java library for parsing (and concretely executing) PCode XML files;
  * and a Java library that translates the parsed PCode AST into Crucible
    programs and provides methods for interacting with the translated program.

The included 'build.sh' script will compile and assemble the various pieces.
It assumes stack is avalaible to build the Haskell code, and
uses Maven to build the Java pieces; Google's protocol buffer compiler
will also need to be installed.  The following configurations are
expected to work:

* OSX "El Capitan" 10.11.6 or Debian GNU/Linux 3.14.15-2
* GHC 7.8.3 or GHC 7.10.3
* stack 1.0.2
* Java 1.6.0 u45
* Maven 3.2.5
* Google Protobuf 2.6.1

Note: the 'protoc' compiler must be in your PATH; or, you may edit
'mss/crucible-server/java_api/pom.xml' to give the path to protoc explicitly.

NOTE: We have recentely switched to using Stack to build this project.
Stack is a new build tool for Haskell projects that greatly simplifies
the building of complicated systems.  Get it at:

Windows builds may work, but have not been tested at all.

To see a top-level view of how to use the combined pieces, take a look at the
following Java file that defines the main function for the generated test executable:
